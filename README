This application is meant to help me to learn more about the Python Django framework. In order to learn more about this
framework I will be following along with a tutorial series I found on YouTube by Corey Schafer. I will be following
along with his videos in order to learn the material but I do not take credit for any of the code that I will write as
it will be provide through the videos. I expect progress I this to be slow due to school work as well as employment at a
part time job.

I want to re-iterate that I do not take credit for any of the code in the django_project directory as it has been pulled
from the video or from the link below. Full credit for the code goes to Corey Schafer, the creator of this series. Also
I have set a deadline for myself, I aim to complete all 17 videos in this series by Christmas of 2021
