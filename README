This application is meant to help me to learn more about the Python Django framework. In order to
learn more about this framework I will be following along with a tutorial series I found on YouTube
by Corey Schafer. I will be following along with his videos in order to learn the material but I do
not take credit for any of the code that I will write as it will be provide through the videos. I
expect progress o this to be slow due to school work as well as employment at a part time job.
